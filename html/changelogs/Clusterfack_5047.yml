changes:
- bugfix: Mommis once again, can no longer pick up the normal material synth, which bugs out when they try to use it
- rscadd: Posibrains should now have their appearance turned back to the original after death, they also have a death message.
- bugfix: Spiderbots wont be prevented from ventcrawling thanks to holding their own brain
- bugfix: Corpses from human-like simple mobs should now spawn correctly again
- tweak: Plastic flaps previously used both airtight mining flaps and regular station flaps. However constructable flaps were automatically airtight. Build stages have been adjusted so you can wrench down a flap to anchor it, and crowbar a normal plastic flap to make it airtight.
