changes:
  - bugfix: Hopefully fixed autolinking on general air control computers and tank control computers with gas sensors and air injectors/vents respectively.
  - rscadd: Hopefully add the ability to link meters to general air control computers.
  - bugfix: Self-built airlock controllers now work, they look broken until you open their UI/use their multitool menu now, the latter of which now works, BTW.
