changes:
  - tweak: Crack the ack, skellingtons no longer selectable from round start.
  - experiment: Skellingtons can no longer eat or drink things and they are just bones
  - experiment: Skellingtons cannot be injected with anything, only way for them to get chems is being touched by them so smoke, cryo, or splashing
  - experiment: Skellingtons have no skin or blood so you can skip skin and blood vessel related steps in surgery for them
  - experiment: Changed movespeed modifiers, hyperzine and other magic sanic sources no longer make you the fastest around and merely give you a -10 tally for each you have so that means if you're fucked enough by cold pain or whatever you can still possibly move slower than you'd like while hopped up on stims. Diona's base speed is unchanged, skellingtons have a +3 modifier which makes them a bit less than half as slow as diona, muton have a +1 modifier.
