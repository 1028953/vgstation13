changes:
  - rscadd: Added a new child of bear called "Skrite". Adminbus only mob that hits like a bear and is twice as tough as one. Skrites move considerably slower than bears, on account of having only one leg, but make up for it with a toxic projectile attack.
  - imageadd: Added skrite sprites to animal.dmi (used the correct animal.dmi this time, sorry niggly, I fucked your pudding)
