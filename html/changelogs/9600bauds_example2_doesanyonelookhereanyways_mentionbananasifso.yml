changes: 
- tweak: When making bottles at a Chemmaster, you will now be prompted to input how many bottles you want to make before being prompted to name the bottles. This is to keep consistency with making pills (prevent bottles named '3'), and also allows the bottles to be automatically named after many units of chemicals they contain.
- rscadd: You can now alt-click Chemmasters and All-in-One Grinders to eject their beaker, if they have one loaded.
