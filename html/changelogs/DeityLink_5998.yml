changes:
  - rscadd: re-added koibeans, novaflowers, and moonflowers. The latter two are now bioluminescent.
  - rscadd: added cinnamomum trees, harvested for cinnamon sticks, and grinded for cinnamon. tower-caps and cinnamomum both appear in the "trees" category of the seed vendor.
  - rscadd: added recipes for cinnamon rolls and cinnamon pie. Guarranted snail-free.
  - imageadd: added a custom condiment sprite for cinnamon.
  - tweak: seed packets now spawn with a slight random offset.
  - rscadd: added 7 new plants, acquired exclusively through Xenoarchaeology. You obtain those plants' seeds by using plant fossiles on the seed extractor.
  - rscadd: added clay pots, obtained by cooking 5 units of water and a piece of sand in a microwave (it just works, ok?)
  - rscadd: you can use spades to transplant a plant from a tray to a clay pot. Note that you cannot get the plant back, so make sure to have some spare seeds or take a sample beforehand.
  - rscadd: once transplanted, the plant stops aging. You can transplant at any stage of the plant's growth, even when it's dead. Transplanting conserves the plant's bioluminescence, but no other seed data, as its purpose is entirely cosmetic.
  - rscadd: clay pots can be picked up while empty, throwing them has a chance to make them shatter.
  - tweak: plant analyzers now tell you if a plant will remove/release gas into the environment, and specify which ones.
  - tweak: digging up a soil mound now yields back a few sand pieces.
  - tweak: spades can now be printed at the autolathe.
  - soundadd: added a sound for when using a shovel/spade.
  - tweak: you can remove vines with the scythe by hitting the turf under them, you no longer need pinpoint accuracy.
