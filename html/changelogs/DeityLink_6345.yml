changes:
  - tweak: Feral bees now select a new target more randomly.
  - rscadd: Added the bee gatling gun. each projectile deals 5 tox damage. Equipments with "bio" armor, will mitigate the damage. Bio suits for instance will completely negate it. Projectiles spawn a bee when they disappear. If they hit a mob the bee is spawned on top of them and will immediately target them, if not they will target a random nearby mob. The projectiles don't damage anything beside mobs.
  - rscadd: Added bee nades. Self explanatory.
