changes:
  - tweak: Added a new realistic method for processing explosions that takes walls and some other obstacles into account (closed Airlocks and Blast Doors)
  - rscadd: Admins can at any time toggle the explosion method (between the old one and the new one) from the Secret panel (requires +SERVER)
  - tweak: Reinforced Floors are now actually bomb resistant, and less likely to break apart from explosions (they don't affect the spread of the explosion at all though, nor the damage to atoms standing on top of it)
  - rscadd: Unsimulated/Shuttle floors now get covered in soot when hit by explosions
  - rscadd: Added a verb to the debug panel that lets you visualize in colours the impacts of an explosion (can be set to use either explosion methods, the colours disappear after 10 seconds)
