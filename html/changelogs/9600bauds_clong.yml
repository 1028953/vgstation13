changes: 
- tweak: Toolboxes now have up to 14 item slots. Much like how plastic bags work, they may hold less than 14 items depending on their total combined size.
- tweak: Toolboxes can now hold many general Engineering items they couldn't hold before. This includes material sheets, power cells, floor tiles, metal rods, RCD, RPD, tile painter, light replacer, improved welding tools, and the station blueprints.
