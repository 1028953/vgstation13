 changes:
  - bugfix: Ghosts can no longer interact with the suspension field generator.
  - bugfix: Ghosts can no longer interact with the artifact harvester.
  - bugfix: Ejecting the battery from the artifact harvester will cause the artifact to unanchor. This is a failsafe mechanism to ensure that perma anchored artifacts NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN!
  - tweak: Moved rotate suspension field verb to objects tab.
  - tweak: Moved toggle bunsen burner to objects tab.
  - tweak: You can no longer accidentally touch trigger large artifacts by using the anomaly harvester
