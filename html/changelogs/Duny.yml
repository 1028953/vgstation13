changes: 
  - wip: Following changes made to Defficiency.
  - tweak: The derelict is now identical to box's.
  - tweak: Added canes in genetics, next to the glasses.
  - bugfix: Made yet another attempt at fixing brig timers.
  - rscadd: Added decals all over maintenance so that the less fortunate when it comes to having a basic sense of direction don't get lost inside the abandoned areas. The paths indicated should always be fairly safe (except from other player shenanigans) and all solars are connected to them. If you stray off the path, you are fair game for any bullshit I could have thought of and added to the abandoned parts to make your life miserable, so grow a pair of balls if you decide to explore. Unlike box, maintenance doesn't form a clear circle around the station. The abandoned parts will often offer good shortcuts if you know how to navigate them.
  - rscadd: Added recycling stuff and a camera to disposals. No incinerator, and none planned.
  - wip: Added some wall-mounted fire and o2 closets, a fire closet, some plasma, more solution trays and beakers and an additional dropper to the research outpost. Fixed floating biohazard sign. The power now also runs through the SMES.
  - wip: All research outpost air alarms can now be unlocked with science access.
  - rscadd: Added a second operating room next to surgery.
  - bugfix: Probably fixed miners being thrown around when leaving the mining station. Maybe.
  - bugfix: Added 2 missing cameras to security.
