delete-after: True
changes: 
  - rscadd: You can now implant any carbon mob (this means no simple animals like corgis, but works on xenos) with implants. These do NOT show up on sechuds unless they are human, however.
  - rscadd: Implants now correctly transfer when you change between monkey/human (including changeling transform). This has been in the code forever but was not functional because monkeys couldn't be implanted.
  - rscadd: The above also applies for diona nymphs evolving into fullblown diona.
  - rscadd: Slimes who split will have the implant be in the one that gets (or would get) the mind of the splitter.
  - rscadd: Xenomorph's who are implanted will keep the implant through every stage of evolution.
  - bugfix: You can no longer cause items to delete by trying to pick them up while you're transforming into a insert mob other than human here.
  - tweak: You can't implant a traitor implant into someone who's loyalty implanted without first removing the loyalty implant. Pretty sure this was intended already, as it was checking twice for the same implant.
