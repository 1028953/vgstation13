changes: 
  - bugfix: Fixed the salvage shuttle not being able to move to its starting location or to the abandoned ship on metaclub
  - tweak: Renamed some docking ports on taxistation (mainly for the salvage shuttle)
  - tweak: The salvage shuttle can now travel to the abandoned mining outpost on taxistation
  - tweak: Shuttles can now be rotated (doesn't work well with multi-tile objects like sleepers or airlocks, so rotation for syndicate, vox and admin shuttle is disabled)
  - tweak: Docking port placement is now better
  - rscadd: The admin shuttle exists once again
