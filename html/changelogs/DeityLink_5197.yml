changes:
  - bugfix: Bloody Floors are now automatically counted if the round is cult, no longer only if the current objective is "bloodspill". (blood splatters being cleaned always decreased the counter, which caused the round end report to almost always show something among the lines of "18 tiles out of 100 covered, SUCCESS!!")
  - tweak: The Round End Information will now indicate what was the peak number of bloody floors during the round, instead of the number of bloody floors at round end.
  - tweak: "bloodspill" now requires the cultists to cover a random number of tiles in blood, minimum being 100, maximum being 101 + (number of players X 3)
  - experiment: Admins now get notified if a player disconnects/ghosts right after being converted.
  - rscadd: The Summon Cultist rune will give its user the list of all the current living and conscious (non-braindead/catatonic) cultists if used without 3 cultists around it.
  - tweak: The Free Cultist rune will now only list cultists that are currently restrained.
  - rscadd: The Free Cultist rune will give its user the list of all the currently restrained culists if used without 3 cultists around it.
  - rscadd: The target of the Free Cultist rune now gets notified that they got freed from their restraints.
