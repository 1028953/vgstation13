changes:
  - bugfix: Newly built Station Alert Computers now check for any ongoing alert. They would previously display no alert at all.
  - tweak: Station Alert Computers built on the station's Z-level now only check for alerts on the main station.
  - tweak: Those computers will also rename themselves upon being built to a name fitting their location (ex, Derelict Station Alert Computer, Research Outpost Alert Computer, Vox Trade Outpost Alert Computer, etc...)
