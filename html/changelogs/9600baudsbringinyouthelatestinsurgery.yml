changes: 
  - tweak: Advanced surgery tools (laser scalpels, incision manager) now speed up surgery steps depending on how advanced they are.
  - tweak: Laser scalpels now only come in two tiers, the first only requires iron and glass to be produced. Low tier laser scalpels will no longer randomly fail.
  - rscadd: Laser scalpels can now properly be used as a scalpel for any surgery steps that require one, and can be switched to a cautery mode to make them work as a cautery.
  - tweak: The Incision Manager can now be used as a retractor for any surgery steps that require one, and no longer costs diamond to produce at the Protolathe.
  - tweak: Butcher's cleavers can now be used as bonesaws in ghetto surgery (like hatchets).
  - tweak: Debraining severed heads now accepts ghetto surgery tools.
  - bugfix: You can now properly cut biomass and kudzu with laser scalpels.
  - bugfix: Laser scalpels now properly change their icon for all surgery steps.
