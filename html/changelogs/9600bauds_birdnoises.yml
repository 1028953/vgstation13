changes: 
- rscadd: Added a 'Wake-Up Cycle' option to Sleepers, which will try to wake up the occupant. This is intended to work as an alternative to the Mancrowave. Alt-clicking a Sleeper while an occupant is inside will automatically start this cycle.
- bugfix: Fixed the Paralysis Summary timer not working properly on Sleepers (this will give you an approximation of how long the occupant's paralysis/sleep would last if left alone).
