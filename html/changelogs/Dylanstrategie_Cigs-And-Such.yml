changes:
  - experimental: Use update_brightness() and update_icon() for all items on the list to minimize shit coding and standardize light items
  - experimental: You can now light cigarettes and sub-types with anything tagged as is_hot(), works with fire (fire_act)
  - experimental: Blunts can now hold 50 units of reagents. Don't ask me, it's a really fat blunt
  - soundadd: Lighters (regular and zippo) now have sounds
  - rscadd: Added a strike-anywhere matchbox. Can only be obtained for premium on cigarettes machines currently
  - rscdel: You can no longer shove an entire matchbox into a cigarette pack
  - tweak: All matchboxes are now a fancy storage with all it entails and contain 21 matches
  - tweak: Match duration from 5 to 10, on par with strike-anywhere matches. Matches do not go out anymore when dropped
  - tweak: Cigarettes and sub-types will be put out when dipped into water and will not light if doused in water
  - tweak: You no longer burn yourself with cheap lighters, instead you'll have to try multiple times to light it (20 % chance)
  - tweak: All lighters now have 5 attack delay (not in seconds)
  - bugfix: Fix multiple cases of cigarette-related items not updating lumcount normally
