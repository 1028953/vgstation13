changes:
  - rscadd: Vending machines can now be deconstructed (doing so will destroy all their remaining articles!) except wall-mounted NanoMeds
  - rscadd: Vending machines Circuit Boards can now be printed at R&D (mat=1,eng=1,pow=1 TL;DR: at round start!)
  - rscadd: Vending machines can be built from machine frames, with a circuit board, a matter bin, a scanning module, and a manipulator.
  - rscadd: Constructed vending machines are empty by default.
  - rscadd: Cargo has a new Order category: "Vending Machine packs"
  - rscadd: Those packs arrive in the supply shuttle coiled together in a stack. Use a wirecutter on it to spawn the packs and the supply manifest.
  - rscadd: Stacks of packs and the packs themselves can be package-wrapped and tagged for the delivery sorting machine.
  - rscadd: Stacks and packs can as well be placed on MULEbots
  - rscadd: Packs have density, so they must be pulled just like crate
  - rscadd: Packs can be drag-n-dropped onto a matching vending machine to refill its content, or onto an empty vending machine to set its contents and appearance.
  - rscadd: Once used, the packs no longer have density and can be picked up, and folded into cardboard.
  - rscadd: There are currently packs for all the vending machines on the station (except the wall-mounted nanomeds, for now...)
  - rscadd: Some savvy and adequatly equipped cargoneers might as well order packs for machines that aren't naturally found anywhere on the station...
  - imageadd: Packages now have a visible and examinable label once they've been tagged
