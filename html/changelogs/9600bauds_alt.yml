changes: 
  - rscadd: Alt-clicking a reagent container (i.e. beaker) while it's in your inventory will now directly bring up the \"Set transfer amount\" menu.
  - rscadd: Alt-clicking a Chemistry Dispenser will now directly eject it's beaker, if any.
  - rscadd: Alt-clicking a portable scrubber or portable pump will now eject their held tank, without having to open their menu.
  - rscadd: Alt-clicking a washing machine will now start it. Likewise for Centrifuges.
  - rscadd: Janicarts have now gained a \"Remove Trash Bag\" verb. Alt-clicking a Janicart will directly remove it's trash bag. Clicking a Janicart while you're riding it will no longer bring up a popup asking what you want to do, it will instead always make you stop riding it. If you want to remove the trash bag while riding it, use the verb or alt-click.
  - experiment: If you can think of any other alt-click shortcuts that you'd like to see in the game, please don't hesitate to write a letter, stamp it, and mail it to my house, but don't make a feature request or people other than me will have to read it, which gets them mad cranky.
