changes:
- rscadd: The following changes are to Defficiency
- rscadd: Ported over metaclubs Centcomm, so ERT and Deathsquad can exist and more room for bus
- rscadd: Added the Vox Skipjack from box, so now Vox Raiders can happen on Defficiency
- rscadd: Added the salvage shuttle to Z level 6, but as Defficiency is defficient of an aux-docking port, it cant dock to the station properly.
- rscadd: Fixed a piping error in xenobiology, gave it and the research corridor some more vents considering the size
- rscadd: Expanded the xenobotany area on the research outpost. It now also has gas-controlled trays (just need to wrench them down)
- rscadd: Added an autolathe to R&D
- rscadd: Fixed a few area mishaps (Area in front of the HoPs office that had no defined area, areas in the SME room that werent correct)
- rscadd: Relocated the Mancrowave in medical to somewhere a bit more sensible, removed the Sec outpost from medical as it was unused.
- rscadd: Removed stools from the brig as they no longer counted as chairs, but weapons.
- rscadd: Added a vox outpost to the asteroid z-level, a bit off the beaten track
