changes:
  - rscadd: Added the "Hostile Infestation" event. Similar to the normal infestation event, though this time with hostile mobs
  - soundadd: Added "bumpinthenight.ogg"
  - rscadd: Added "Silent Meteors" event. Adminbus only, not random, allows for admins to send meteors without a command report. I'm sure this will never be abused, ever.
  - rscadd: Added "Organic Debris Field" event. Similar to meteors except instead of killing everyone, it splatters the outside of the station with gore, body parts, organs, exploding corpses...
  - rscadd: Added "Mass Drunkenness" event. Causes everyone on the station to be drunk for less than a minute.
