changes:
  - experiment: Singularity now has movement bias. When roaming randomly, it will prefer repeating its previous movement, leading to more significant "movement streaks"
  - experiment: Introduce reagent_filling bottles. Basically, you can now see reagent amount and color in bottles dynamically, akin to beakers
  - tweak: Singularity name and description no longer resets, useful for admins feeling poetic*
  - tweak: Singularities are now a tiny bit more likely to head towards beacons
  - rscdel: Old colored bottles are no longer used due to not being compatible with the new bottle system. Option to choose bottles also removed. Reagent color should make up for it partially
