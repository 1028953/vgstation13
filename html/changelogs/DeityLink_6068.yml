changes:
  - bugfix: Bank accounts no longer have a chance to spawn with Zero security (aka the "ATM stays unlocked with all my info" bug)
  - rscadd: "\"Balance Check\" app now re-dubbed \"Virtual Wallet and Balance Check\". Installed on all PDAs by default. Lets you check the transactions and balance of both your bank account and your ID's virtual wallet. Lets you print and absorb currency (only bills for now)."
  - rscadd: ATMs let you transfer funds between your bank account and your virtual wallet. Credits withdrawn at an ATM no longer have a chance of appearing "behind" the ATM.
  - rscadd: If you're wearing a wallet on your ID slot, withdrawing money at an ATM or printing currency with a PDA will send the credits directly inside your wallet. Wallets can now also be bought at Merch Computers.
  - imageadd: Added lots of new wallet sprites for every kind of IDs. Up'd wallet storage slots from 10 to 20. Can also be worn on belts now.
  - tweak: Credit Chips can now only contain up to 10 bills of one kind, down from 100. You're more likely to see big stacks of dosh now.
  - rscadd: Starting money for both virtual wallet and bank account are random between 100 and 250. Which means between 200 and 500 total dosh at round start.
  - bugfix: Fixed a Station Map app bug that caused BoxStation's map to not render.
  - rscadd: When your ID is in your PDA, you can transfer money to other people's PDAs. They'll receive a notification and get the money as soon as they put their IDs in their PDA.
  - rscadd: Vending machines and the like now use credits from your Virtual Wallet by default. The exception is the Cargo supply computers which still use bank accounts since payments are delayed.
  - tweak: Setting your bank account's security to Zero lets you make purchases using your bank account's money when your virtual wallet has insufficient funds.
  - bugfix: The cargo tax is now part of the supply pack's price (20% of it).
  - rscdel: Service borgs cannot print dosh anymore. (Sorry guys)
