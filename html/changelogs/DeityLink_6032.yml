changes:
  - rscadd: Moving/Thrown atoms and projectiles now preserve speed and inertia when moving through hand-tele portals. Emitter beams can go through them as well.
  - tweak: Hand-Tele "chance of failure" is no longer determined when the atom crosses the portal, but instead when the portal is created.
  - imageadd: New portal sprite that shows a glimpse of the destination.
  - rscadd: Hand-Tele now spawns "pairs" of linked portals. Atoms that cross a portal are sent right on top of their linked portal.
  - rscadd: You can hit a portal with the hand-tele that created them to instantly delete both linked portals.
  - rscadd: You can hit a portal with your hand or another item to go through them. Useful if the portal is right underneath you, or on top of a wall.
  - soundadd: Portals have new sounds.
  - rscadd: Added an admin spawnable-only Portal Gun.
