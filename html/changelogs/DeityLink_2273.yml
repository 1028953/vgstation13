changes:
  - bugfix: Fixed an issue that would cause bloody footprints to appear white and always facing south on pictures.
  - bugfix: Vox and Diona blood (splattered when you hit them with strong weapons) now appears respectively blue and green. Previously you would only see these colours if they got gibbed. (This issue is fixed for other species datums as well of course)
  - bugfix: Those blood splatter now properly carry their DNA and viruses.
  - bugfix: Blood on shoes and on clothes now properly appears of the correct colour. So does vomit.
  - bugfix: Wounds on species other than human appear with a filter of their respective blood colours.
  - bugfix: Fixed many other small blood-related issues.
  - imageadd: Vox footprints now look like claws. The sprites were unused in the game files.
