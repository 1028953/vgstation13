delete-after: True

changes: 
- experiment: Added two special attacks - kicks and bites. Players can now select their preferred attack type on their HUD (the buttons are next to throw and drop). Hotkey for kicking is 5 or CTRL 5. Hotkey for biting is 6 or CTRL 6.
- experiment: Special attacks proc when clicking something on harm intent. You need both of your feet to perform a kick. You need at least two teeth or a beak to bite. Kicks have 2x the normal attack delay.
- tweak: Kicking a vending machine now requires you to enable the Kick special attack.
- tweak: Kicking a lying human turns the attack into a stomp, dealing double damage.
- tweak: Kicking a small item sends it flying.
- tweak: SWAT shoes, combat boots and jackboots increase kick damage. Stomping on somebody while wearing magboots deals a lot of damage.
- tweak: Talons increase kick damage if not wearing shoes. Vox now have talons.
- rscadd: Vampires have to enable the Bite special attack to drain blood. Vampires can bite while wearing masks.
