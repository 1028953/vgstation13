changes: 
- tgs: "Ported automatic material stacking from TG, full credits to MrPerson. This means that some stackable items (such as floortiles, cable coils, metal sheets etc) will now try to stack with eachother when they're in the same tile. This allows you to, for example, drag a floortile behind yourself to scoop up all the loose tiles in a hallway."
