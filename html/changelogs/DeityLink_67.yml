changes:
  - rscadd: added Clownpiece's jumpsuit, hat, and wings to the Autodrobe. We Toho 15 now!
  - rscadd: using *aflap while wearing the wings will visibly make them flap a bit.
  - rscadd: added an admin-spawned-only version of the wings that allows players to fly, similarly to brooms wielded by wizards.
