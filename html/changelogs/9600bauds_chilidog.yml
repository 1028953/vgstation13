changes: 
- rscadd: Cryo cells now pop you out at a safe temperature once again, though just cold enough to give you the jitters for a few seconds. However, it takes 4 seconds to eject somebody from a Cryo cell. Essentially, the Mancrowave's body heat regulation functionality was directly implemented into Cryo.
- rscadd: Cryo cells now also give a short period of grace to non-oxygen-breathing races after being ejected from Cryo, in which they won't breathe (and Plasmamen won't combust) so that they may be given internals safely. This is to replace the effects of post-cryo Hypothermia, which made people not breathe.
