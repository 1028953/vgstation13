changes:
  - rscadd: Deconstructing a Cloning Pod removes the Biomass from it as Synthmeat slabs.
  - tweak: Built Cloning Pods are now empty of any biomass (fixing an exploit that'd reset the biomass to 150 every time the machine was deconstructed-reconstructed) doesn't affect Cloning Pods already built at roundstart.
