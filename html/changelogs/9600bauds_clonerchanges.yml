changes: 
  - rscadd: Cloners now give a special message when scanning a ghosted, but otherwise cloneable corpse, which bwoinks the ghost and tells you to try scanning again in 5 seconds (like the Defib)
  - bugfix: Fixed Defibs sometimes thinking a corpse was revivable when it wasn't, fixes Defibs reviving suicided players (which would then quickly die again since you can't stop suiciding)
  - bugfix: Fixed Morgue displays not working correctly (green light = ghost inside corpse, red light = ghosted, orange light = no corpse, items inside)
