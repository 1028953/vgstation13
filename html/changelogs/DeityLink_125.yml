changes:
  - bugfix: Enthralling used to take 10 times less time than it was meant to (5 seconds, 2.5 with charisma. instead of 50 seconds, 25 with charisma). It's been balanced to 30 seconds, 15 with charisma. At the very least you cannot be enthralled just by being slipped on a banana anymore. That should solve part of the enthralling problem.
  - imageadd: Shadowstep now leaves a brief animation behind.
  - tweak: Mist Form replaced with Bat Jaunt. Doesn't extinguish you anymore, but leaves a scary bat behind. Also new animations.
