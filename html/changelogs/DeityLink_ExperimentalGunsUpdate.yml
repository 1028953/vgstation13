changes:
  - experiment: THE EXPERIMENTAL GUNS UPDATE IS LIVE!!
  - experiment: 10 NEW ORIGINAL WEAPONS ADDED. Half of them can be obtained during any round, the other half have certain requirements. I won't go into details here. Have fun trying to get them all!
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that caused the Power Gloves's electrical arc to be invisible, and refined its code so the arc looks much nicer.
  - rscadd: Reworked projectile pathing and appearance. Projectiles now follow a proper Bresenham path, which means you're less likely to hit something that you didn't intend to hit.
  - rscadd: Projectiles appear to follow a linear path, coders can force specific projectiles to not appear linear. The Captain's laser gun and the Retro laser gun's projectiles don't appear linear. (but still follow a Bresenham path)
  - rscadd: Turrets, Mechas, and ED209 projectiles follow the new pathing as well.
  - rscadd: Turrets now make noises when they fire.
  - imageadd: Replaced recharger sprites. Players can see which gun is currently being recharged. They know also have a visibly different sprite when they are unanchored. You can longer place a gun in an unanchored recharger.
  - tweak: The Syndicate RPG now uses an actual rocket launcher fire sound, instead of a shotgun sound. Fired RPG projectiles now pick up speed gradually over half a second instead of being at bullet speed from the get go.
  - rscadd: "Destroying" projectiles such as pulse rifle beams can now also destroy tables.
  - rscadd: All projectiles now have a penetration variable, and all objects/mobs have a penetration_dampening variable. What this means for example is that bullets will now keep going after hitting a window. Projectiles can be made to only penetrate certain types of atoms. When a projectile goes through a wall, it loses a bit of damage and leaves markings on it, those can be removed with a soldering tool.
  - rscadd: All projectiles can now bounce off atoms. Beams now properly bounce off a player wearing an ablative armor. Ablative armor chance of deflection slightly increased. Energy based projectiles (such as ion bolts or electrodes), or staff of change/focus projectiles can be deflected as well.
  - bugfix: Fixed reinforced walls/girder being indestructible by destroying projectiles.
  - tweak: Slightly increased the size at which items placed in display cases appear.
  - bugfix: Damage overlays are now properly updated after you get hit by a projectile.
  - tweak: Ear deafness now gradually reduces the volume of sounds instead of completly blocking them off.
  - bugfix: Modification Kits (such as the one that turn atmos hardsuits into their gold versions) can no longer be used at infinite range. Coders can now easily add new modification kits that can turn any item into any other item, not just hardsuits.
