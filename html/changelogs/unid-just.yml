changes: 
  - rscadd: Trees may be cut down with sharp and big enough objects, yielding from 3 to 8 big logs.
  - rscadd: Trees fall in a random direction when chopped down. Standing in a large tree's way is a sure way to get some broken bones, and you can see the direction in which the tree is going to fall before it's cut down.
