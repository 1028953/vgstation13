changes: 
- tweak: Inspired by, but not copypasted from, Gooncode, the NOIR mutation, or any other colour change now fades in and out slowly.
- rscadd: Adds a colour_matrix variable to both simple animals and eye organs
- rscadd: Vox eyes make them colourblind, rendering blue and green undistinguishable. You may avoid this by setting eyes to be mechanical in character preferences.
- rscadd: Ian is now also colourblind in the same respect.
