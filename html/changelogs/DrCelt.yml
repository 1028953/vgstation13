  - experiment: SUMMARY
  - rscadd: Heat transfer Rehaul
  - rscadd: Hypothermia added
  - rscadd: changes to things that cause cold damage
  - rscadd: space blankets
  - rscadd: ghetto space suits with space blankets
  - rscadd: thermal homeostasis regulator that when emagged becomes the mancrowave
  - tweak: changes to cryo
  - experiment: INDEPTH EXPLANATION OF HEAT TRANSFER
  - tweak: removes useless variables heat_protection & cold_protection as these were in 99% of circumstances the exact same as body_parts_covered
  - rscadd: added a new variable, heat_conductivity to all items, determining how fast they conduct heat away from you
  - rscadd: added new procs to humans, sweat() & burn_calories() - Now whenever you use up nutriment, you generate heat, but can also expend nutriment to decrease heat.
  - rscadd: refactored how heat transfer away from humans worked ( see above)
  - experiment: INDEPTH EXPLANATION OF HYPOTHERMIA
  - rscadd: added Mild Hypothermia (between 32 and 35C) - this results in shivering, minor slowdown and messages informing the player that they are cold.
  - rscadd: added Moderate hypothermia (between 28 and 32C) - Shivering stops, slowdown increases, may slur/stutter words, chance of dropping items in hand and collapsing temporarily, as well as a 25% chance of forgetting how to use machines like when braindamaged
  - rscadd: added severe hypothermia (24 to 28C), shivering stops, player is unconcious, pulse decreases to 30BPM and has a 25% chance of taking 5 oxygen damage, which decreases over time as you are still breathing.
  - rscadd: added profound hypothermia (less than 24C), pulse stops, player has a 25% chance of taking 5 oxygen damage, does not decrease over time as they are not breathing.
  - tweak: CHANGES THINGS WHICH CAUSE COLD DAMAGE, including but not limited to coldingtons, cryokinesis, showers, goliaths, temperature gun, and chemicals which chill people. Foam fire extinguishers are not affected.
  - experiment: THERMAL HOMEOSTASIS REGULATOR
  - experiment: Please use this when taking someone out of cryo
  - tweak: When a person is dragged in, it will automatically begin stabilising, there is no need for more buttons to be pressed
  - tweak: Takes 5 seconds to heat/cool someone to 37C, which works out as quicker than shaking someone up.
  - rscadd: Can be emagged to allow for three extra settings - this process is extremely visible, and there is a different sprite for when an emagged function is used
  - rscadd: Can reenable security features to quickly unemag the device and Can bring the device to an emergency stop.
  - experiment: CHANGES TO CRYO
  - tweak: Cryo now releases someone at 23C instead of -12C (or 25C if they manually eject)
  - experiment: PLEASE USE THE THERMAL HOMEOSTASIS REGULATOR AFTER TAKING PEOPLE OUT OF CRYO
  - tweak: Manual eject time brought down from 2 minutes to 30 seconds to make it time-neutral
  - tweak: This means that, as the person is ejected below profound hypothermia, they will not breathe until they heat up a wee bit further. This is a positive change, as vox & plasmamen will no longer die from toxin damage/fire immediately after leaving cryo.
  - rscadd: People inside a cryo cell do not suffer from hypothermia until leaving.
