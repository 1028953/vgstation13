changes: 
  - rscadd: Merged flags_inv and body_parts_covered
  - rscadd: Made a bunch of body_parts_covered defines in setup.dm, replaced all instances of body_parts_covered being snowflakey except one, because gladiator outfits are really strange
  - rscadd: This means that from now on, it should be far easier to add items as there is no longer a concern about getting either variable above correct, and one can simply reference setup.dm to find an appropriate define
  - bugfix: fixed clothing being contaminated undesirably
  - bugfix: fixes a bunch of unreported bugs due to the nature of the PR varying from the HoP jacket the riot suit and the stallhelm. If there is a bug where a sprite was overriding where it should not have this SHOULD fix that
  - experimental: this SHOULD also prevent that type of bug ever happening again.
  - rscadd: adds is_slot_hidden proc
  - tweak: splits head thermal conductivity into three parts
  - bugfix: fixed a bug where agent gas masks would conceal identities when they should not have.
