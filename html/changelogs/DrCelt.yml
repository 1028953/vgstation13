- rscadd: Had to hand in my Pull Request to the Chief - He'd always had it out for me, and the code ain't ever been in my favour, not since the war anyway. I looked it all over once more, tryin' to get to the bottom of this mystery, but it ain't easy finding bugs in some downtrodden code like this.I thought of that paddy dame that showed up in my office last week, asking for me to help her. Said someone called 'Gene Ettics' went AWOL. I told her I'd do what I could, and that's why I'm here. I opened up my flask of brandy and took a sip. It was going to be a long night. Chief or no chief, I'm getting to the bottom of this case.
- rscadd: Re-adds the Noir Block.
