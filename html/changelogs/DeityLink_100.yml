changes:
  - imageadd: Re-made most bee-related sprites.
  - imageadd: Bees animate much more smoothly, and are actually easily visible now.
  - rscadd: You can now examine apiaries to get a clue whether there are bees inside or not, and how much honey there is.
 - imageadd: The apiary's sprite also updates depending on how much honey there is inside.
  - tweak: Reworked the procedure to harvest Honeycombs.
  - rscdel: You cannot obtain honey by merely using a beaker on an apiary anymore.
  - imageadd: Added a custom sprite for honey-storing condiment bottles.
  - rscadd: Hitting a bee or firing at it will now cause it and its neighbors to charge at the attacker.
  - bugfix: Bees can finally be calmed by spraying them with water. They also have a slightly different sprite when they are feral.
  - rscadd: You can now use bee nets by clicking on tiles instead of clicking on the item in your hand.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that cause apiaries to feed WAY too much nutrients to the hydro trays near it.
  - tweak: Apiaries still distribute and gather nutrients automatically, however, the "benefits" they give to nearby plants are now granted by the bees themselves. If a bee is above a plant ready for harvest, it'll halve its aging process so it remains alive longer, else it'll accelerate it so it becomes ready for harvest more quickly. It'll also halve the plant's weed and pest spread, and collect some of the plant's toxins for the apiary. (Toxins collected this way will find their way into the honeycombs, and will also drastically increase the sting power of bees).
  - rscadd: Added chapters to "The Ins and Outs of Apiculture - A Precise Art" manual that explains how to capture feral bees and how to harvest honeycombs.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug that allowed players to use modification kits at any range.
  - rscadd: Added a beekeeping bio suit and hood to the Beekeeping Crates, as well as a copy of the Beekeeping Manual, and a mini-extinguisher.
