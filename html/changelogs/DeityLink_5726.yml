changes:
  - rscadd: Revamped bike horns. Their honk sound is now their hitsound, so hitting someone with a bike horn will make it honk. That also means that admins can replace that sound with anything.
  - soundadd: Rubber duckies finally make a quack sound, totally ripped from Duck Game. They can also be pressed twice as fast as regular bike horns since their sound is shorter.
  - rscadd: Bike horns' press delay is now tied to a variable, which admins can edit, so honking faster than Hokuto no Ken is now possible.
