changes: 
- bugfix: Fixed a very bizzare bug that could result in humans (especially monkeymen and head transplanted players) having TWO different blood types, each one of them only used for certain things.
- bugfix: Monkeymen will now properly have randomized blood types.
- rscdel: Players will now have randomized blood types as well. Random blood types follow a weighted distribution. Hopefully this will save Medbay from a lot of headaches.
- experiment: "The blood type distribution is as follows: 36% O+, 28% A+, 20% B+, 5% AB+, 4% O-, 3% A-, 1% B-, 1% AB-. This is the same distribution Monkeymen were supposed to have, although a bug prevented it from working properly."
- experiment: Remind yourself that you can check your blood type by examining your ID. Same goes for checking other people's blood type.
