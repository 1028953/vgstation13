changes:
  - imagedel: purged head.dmi and suit.dmi of all their obsolete sideways sprites which were clogging up the dmi and preventing additional sprites to be added.
  - rscadd: added Bomberman Head and Bomberman Suit. Spaceworthy, offer the same protection that science's bomb suits have (aka you won't get gibbed, and explosion that don't kill you hurt you a bit less).
  - rscadd: added Bomberman's Bomb Dispenser. BBD for short. Too big for a bag of holding, but can fit in Bomberman Suit's pocket.
  - rscadd: just like in the game, the dispenser tracks how many bombs you can place, and their power (1 bomb and 1 range by default). It also tracks any other power-up you pick up.
  - rscadd: power-ups come out of destroyed walls, and can only be picked by players holding a BBD. they include: "bomb-up, power bomb, fire, full fire, skate, line bomb, kick, and skull"
  - rscadd: the skull power-up's disease is picked among: "small bomb, fast pace, slow pace, diarrhea, constipation, change, and fire" (all diseases except change and fire last 40 seconds. for now you can't transmit them to other players).
  - rscadd: by default, bombs only destroy "soft walls", power-ups, and if a player holding a BBD is caught in an explosion, the BBD will be destroyed and its power-ups spilled.
  - rscadd: admins can globally set all the BBD in the world to deal actual damage to players, and destroy walls, grilles, windows, tables, etc...
  - rscadd: admins can turn all the players in the world into Bomberman by the push of a button.
  - rscadd: admins can as well remove every single Bomberman-related atom in the world by the push of a button.
  - experiment: admins can spawn self-constructing bomberman arenas. However for now they'll have to place the players inside manually. arenas spawn with a camera, allowing players in the bar to check the game.
  - imageadd: added a bunch of bomberman sprites.
  - soundadd: added a bunch of bomberman sounds.
