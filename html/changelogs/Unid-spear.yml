changes: 
  - tweak: The damage spears deal is now affected by the sharpness of the shard used to create it
  - tweak: Creation of a spear now takes some time, and can be interrupted
  - tweak: Changed how throwing a glass shard at a wall affects the shard's damage (now damage is either randomly increased or decreased)
