changes:
  - bugfix: Cult objectives and stuff should work fine in Mixed mode now. Might require some live testing so please give feedback at github.com/d3athrow/vgstation13/pull/7813 if you end up in a Mixed cult round.
  - bugfix: Fixed new blood splatters not properly replicating the DNA of other blood splatters on their same turfs unless the round is cult.
