changes:
 - tweak: Masks do not protect against facehuggers. Wear a face-covering helmet such as a RIG helmet or bio hood.
 - experiment: Helmets have a 50% chance to be removed on facehugger attacks. This is a temporary balance change, but may stay if it this turns out to be enough.
 - bugfix: Facehugger toys will not forcefully remove headgear or path on their own. They will still leap at you if you walk next to them though.
 - bugfix: Sterile/non-real facehuggers will not protect against virile or real facehuggers.
