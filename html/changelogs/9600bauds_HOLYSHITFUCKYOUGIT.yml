changes: 
- bugfix: Fixed stackable items (metal rods, floortiles etc) only giving one item's worth of materials when recycled at an Autolathe, regardless of how many items there were in the stack. Also fixes metal rods and possibly more items having the same bug or not working at all in the Recycler. Given that this had been broken for over half a year with seemingly no reports, I'm obliged to say once again that if you notice anything weird with this fix, you should make an in-game bug report.
