changes: 
  - rscadd: "The Sound Synthetizer now uses a popup list to choose between sounds."
  - soundadd: "Tweaked some Sound Synthetizer sounds that were particularly hard to hear to make them a bit louder. Also disabled random pitch in a couple of Synthetizer sounds that normally do not have randomized pitch, so they sound a little more closer to the real deal."
  - soundadd: "Added 4 sounds to the Sound Synthetizer, each one more annoying than the last, at least two of which may have comedic potential."
