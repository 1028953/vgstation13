changes:
  - bugfix: Massive improvements to wall code. More modular, less fucking outdated
  - bugfix: Fix walls making welder noises when the plating is ripped off, even on reinforced walls or miscallenaous destruction
  - imageadd: Custom sprites for displaced reinforced girders
  - tweak: Change names of all girder types to make their nature more obvious
  - experiment: You can no longer magically fix a reinforced wall by slapping a metal sheet on it
  - rscadd: New repairing steps added. You can examine reinforced walls to see their deconstruction progress
  - tweak: Reinforced wall construction slightly longer. Two steps were added
  - rscadd: Add wallrot and thermite status to examine text. General fixes to both (more work is planned)
  - tweak: Igniting thermite is now possible with all "hot" objects but takes ten seconds
  - bugfix: You can now scrub wallrot off reinforced walls, as intended
  - rscadd: Reinforced walls now have custom ex_act procs, which will make them more solid against explosions (they used to have the same strenght as normal walls outside of ex_act 3)
  - rscdel: Diamond walls can no longer be drilled. More work should be done down the line on mineral walls
  - tweak: Singularity now rips regular wall plating more often at 5x5 and 7x7 stage
