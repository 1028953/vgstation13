changes: 
  - tweak: External blood loss has been slowed by 25%, though you'll still lose roughly the same amount of blood.
  - rscadd: Lying down will reduce the amount of blood you lose from external bleeding by 30% (This goes a longer way than it sounds). If you can't stop the bleeding, your best bet is to lie down and call for help or have someone drag you.
  - tweak: "Tweaked low blood level warnings to give a little of a warning transition between \"mostly fine\" and \"going into shock\"."
  - tweak: Slightly tweaked the effect of low blood levels, previously medium blood loss would be deadlier than heavy blood loss. It will still kill you pretty dead.
