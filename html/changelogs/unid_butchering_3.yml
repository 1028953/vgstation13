changes: 
  -rscadd: Teeth of aliens and some other animals may be harvested now
  -rscadd: Hitting a human in the mouth with a heavy object or punching him has a chance to knock some of his teeth out. Currently this doesn't negatively affect the victim.
  -rscadd: Aliens and monkeys can be butchered and skinned. In addition, aliens can be declawed.
  -tweak: Butchering non-animals (aliens and monkeys) requires you to use a new Butcher verb, and doesn't destroy their corpses.
  -tweak: Species with claws (tajara) or beaks (vox) can butcher things faster, and can do so without any tools
  -tweak: Examining now tells you whether a mob has been butchered in any way (including skinning)
  -rscadd: Using 5 cable coils on an alien claw or a stack of teeth will create a necklace
