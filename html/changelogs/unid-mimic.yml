changes: 
  - tweak: Mimics now sleep until somebody attempts to interact with them. When they stop attacking, they go back to sleep and regenerate.
  - tweak: Attempting to snipe a mimic from distance will result in it going berserk.
  - rscadd: Added item mimics and chest mimics.
  - rscadd: Chest mimics are more robust and have a grabbing attack which weakens its victims. Attacking chest mimics with sharp objects will interrupt the grabbing attack.
  - rscadd: Added mimic meat. Rolling pins, holy water and the Boo spell can interact with it
  - rscdel: Mimics no longer spawn from gold slime cores
