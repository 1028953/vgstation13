CONTRIBUTING TO VGSTATION
=========================

1. **Only submit PRs that are ready to be pulled.**  PRs that are not ready will be closed.
2. **Pull requests must be atomic.**  Change one set of related things at a time.  Bundling sucks for everyone.
3. **Test your changes.**  PRs that do not compile will not be accepted.
